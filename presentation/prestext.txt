thx

what am i going to talk about?

going to talk about a remake of paceman

that i made in canvas and js

so here’s an outline

presentation of me
me and js?

game close-up / presentation
why did i make it?
remake the classics portray pm as a douchebag

some aspects:

code overview

code structure (”engine”)

input

animation frame

drawing canvas
slight api!


javascript

inheritance
animal dog cat rhinoceros poisonous rhino

interfaces

but tedious to implement and multiple inheritance
one long chain of inheritance (my preferred choice in Swift, for example)

however in script you can just fucking do it!

what is my relation to js
but i sort of love it
why? i don’t know
foreach a in array

swift also python
semicolons are stupid
but then i remember like omg!!! i don’t need them

also nice in js: chrome! developer tools! firefox/iceweasel.
